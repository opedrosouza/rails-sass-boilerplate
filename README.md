# Rails 7 Saas Boilerplate

Create a sass app using rails 7 really faster than normal.

## The why

Every time I had to start a new app I had to create everything from beginning and I'm tired of have to do install the basic gems that I believe almost all my apps need to have. So I decided to create this boilerplate which should have all basic configs, gems and should allow me to focus mostly on the implementation of the code that my apps need to work.
